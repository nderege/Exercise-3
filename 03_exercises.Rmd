## Setting up on GitHub!

Before starting your assignment, you need to get yourself set up on GitHub and make sure GitHub is connected to R Studio. To do that, you should read the instruction (through the "Cloning a repo" section) and watch the video [here](https://github.com/llendway/github_for_collaboration/blob/master/github_for_collaboration.md). Then, do the following (if you get stuck on a step, don't worry, I will help! You can always get started on the homework and we can figure out the GitHub piece later):

* Create a repository on GitHub, giving it a nice name so you know it is for the 3rd weekly exercise assignment (follow the instructions in the document/video).  
* Copy the repo name so you can clone it to your computer. In R Studio, go to file --> New project --> Version control --> Git and follow the instructions from the document/video.  
* Download the code from this document and save it in the repository folder/project on your computer.  
* In R Studio, you should then see the .Rmd file in the upper right corner in the Git tab (along with the .Rproj file and probably .gitignore).  
* Check all the boxes of the files in the Git tab and choose commit.  
* In the commit window, write a commit message, something like "Initial upload" would be appropriate, and commit the files.  
* Either click the green up arrow in the commit window or close the commit window and click the green up arrow in the Git tab to push your changes to GitHub.  
* Refresh your GitHub page (online) and make sure the new documents have been pushed out.  
* Back in R Studio, knit the .Rmd file. When you do that, you should have two (as long as you didn't make any changes to the .Rmd file, in which case you might have three) files show up in the Git tab - an .html file and an .md file. The .md file is something we haven't seen before and is here because I included `keep_md: TRUE` in the YAML heading. The .md file is a markdown (NOT R Markdown) file that is an interim step to creating the html file. They are displayed fairly nicely in GitHub, so we want to keep it and look at it there. Click the boxes next to these two files, commit changes (remember to include a commit message), and push them (green up arrow).  
* As you work through your homework, save and commit often, push changes occasionally (maybe after you feel finished with an exercise?), and go check to see what the .md file looks like on GitHub.  
* If you have issues, let me know! This is new to many of you and may not be intuitive at first. But, I promise, you'll get the hang of it! 



## Instructions

* Put your name at the top of the document. 

* **For ALL graphs, you should include appropriate labels.** 

* Feel free to change the default theme, which I currently have set to `theme_minimal()`. 

* Use good coding practice. Read the short sections on good code with [pipes](https://style.tidyverse.org/pipes.html) and [ggplot2](https://style.tidyverse.org/ggplot2.html). **This is part of your grade!**

* When you are finished with ALL the exercises, uncomment the options at the top so your document looks nicer. Don't do it before then, or else you might miss some important warnings and messages.


## Warm-up exercises with garden data

These exercises will reiterate what you learned in the "Expanding the data wrangling toolkit" tutorial. If you haven't gone through the tutorial yet, you should do that first.

  1. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest weight in pounds for each vegetable and day of week (HINT: use the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Display the results so that the vegetables are rows but the days of the week are columns.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(day_week = wday(date, label = TRUE),
         weight_lbs = weight * .00220462) %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, day_week) %>% 
  summarize(total_harvest_lbs = sum(weight_lbs)) %>% 
  arrange(day_week, vegetable) %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = day_week,
              values_from = total_harvest_lbs)
```

  2. Summarize the `garden_harvest` data to find the total harvest in pound for each vegetable variety and then try adding the plot from the `garden_planting` table. This will not turn out perfectly. What is the problem? How might you fix it?

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  group_by(vegetable, variety) %>% 
  summarize(weight_lbs = sum(weight * .00220462)) %>%
  left_join(garden_planting, 
            by = c("vegetable", "variety"))
```

We started with 67 rows, but now we have 93. There were some of the same things planted in different plots, which accounts for why there are more rows. Therefore, the weight harvested was accounted for multiple times, even if the vegetable was harvested only once. If you looked at some of the varieties for some vegetables that were planted in different plots, you will see that the weights are repeated. Maybe by combining the plots where duplicate varieties were planted, we could see that there were multiple plots for one variety, but still the same weight_lbs. This would also reduce the number of rows back to 67.


  3. I would like to understand how much money I "saved" by gardening, for each vegetable type. Describe how I could use the `garden_harvest` and `garden_spending` datasets, along with data from somewhere like [this](https://products.wholefoodsmarket.com/search?sort=relevance&store=10542) to answer this question. You can answer this in words, referencing various join functions. You don't need R code but could provide some if it's helpful.
  
Take the vegetable and weight from the Garden Harvest Data, and join it with the price with tax from garden spending. Then, compare the prices of produce from Whole Foods based on weight in order to see how much it would cost you to buy the same weight of vegetables from Whole Foods as it would be to grow those vegetables from seeds.


  4. Subset the data to tomatoes. Reorder the tomato varieties from smallest to largest first harvest date. Create a barplot of total harvest in pounds for each variety, in the new order.CHALLENGE: add the date near the end of the bar. (This is probably not a super useful graph because it's difficult to read. This is more an exercise in using some of the functions you just learned.)

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  filter(vegetable == "tomatoes") %>% 
  group_by(variety) %>% 
  summarize(total_g = sum(weight),
            first_day = (min(date))) %>% 
  mutate(total_lbs = total_g * .00220462) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = fct_rev(fct_reorder(variety, first_day)), #first input is what you want to be reordered by first day
             x = total_lbs)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity",
           fill = "firebrick1") +
  labs(title = "Total Harvest in Pounds for Each Variety",
       x = "Weight",
       y = "Variety")
```

  5. In the `garden_harvest` data, create two new variables: one that makes the varieties lowercase and another that finds the length of the variety name. Arrange the data by vegetable and length of variety name (smallest to largest), with one row for each vegetable variety. HINT: use `str_to_lower()`, `str_length()`, and `distinct()`.
  
```{r}
garden_harvest %>%
  mutate(variety_lower = str_to_lower(variety),
         variety_name_length = str_length(str_to_lower(variety))) %>%
  distinct(variety, vegetable, 
           .keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  arrange(vegetable, variety_name_length)
```

  6. In the `garden_harvest` data, find all distinct vegetable varieties that have "er" or "ar" in their name. HINT: `str_detect()` with an "or" statement (use the | for "or") and `distinct()`.

```{r}
garden_harvest %>% 
  mutate(er_or_ar = str_detect(variety, "er | ar")) %>% 
  distinct(vegetable, variety)
```


## Bicycle-Use Patterns

In this activity, you'll examine some factors that may influence the use of bicycles in a bike-renting program.  The data come from Washington, DC and cover the last quarter of 2014.

<center>

![A typical Capital Bikeshare station. This one is at Florida and California, next to Pleasant Pops.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_station.jpg){width="30%"}


![One of the vans used to redistribute bicycles to different stations.](https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/bike_van.jpg){width="30%"}

</center>

Two data tables are available:

- `Trips` contains records of individual rentals
- `Stations` gives the locations of the bike rental stations

Here is the code to read in the data. We do this a little differently than usual, which is why it is included here rather than at the top of this file. To avoid repeatedly re-reading the files, start the data import chunk with `{r cache = TRUE}` rather than the usual `{r}`.

```{r cache=TRUE}
data_site <- 
  "https://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/2014-Q4-Trips-History-Data.rds" 
Trips <- readRDS(gzcon(url(data_site)))
Stations<-read_csv("http://www.macalester.edu/~dshuman1/data/112/DC-Stations.csv")
```

**NOTE:** The `Trips` data table is a random subset of 10,000 trips from the full quarterly data. Start with this small data table to develop your analysis commands. **When you have this working well, you should access the full data set of more than 600,000 events by removing `-Small` from the name of the `data_site`.**

### Temporal patterns

It's natural to expect that bikes are rented more at some times of day, some days of the week, some months of the year than others. The variable `sdate` gives the time (including the date) that the rental started. Make the following plots and interpret them:

  7. A density plot, which is a smoothed out histogram, of the events versus `sdate`. Use `geom_density()`.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = sdate)) +
  geom_density() +
  labs(title = "Density of Bike Rides",
       y = "",
       x = "Time")
```
  
This graph demonstrates the number of rides (or the density) over time. This demonstrates that over the winter months, the density of bike rides decreased significantly, which makes sense because it is colder and fewer people will be biking. Earlier in the season, there are more bike rides because of the warmth at that time.


  8. A density plot of the events versus time of day.  You can use `mutate()` with `lubridate`'s  `hour()` and `minute()` functions to extract the hour of the day and minute within the hour from `sdate`. Hint: A minute is 1/60 of an hour, so create a variable where 3:30 is 3.5 and 3:45 is 3.75.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + (minute(sdate))/60) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "lightblue") +
  labs(title = "Trend in Bike Rides at Time of Day",
       y = "",
       x = "Time")
```

  This graph demonstrates the trend in bike rides over time of day across all months. The time is in hours, and it demonstrates that there are the most number of rides in the morning, when people are commuting to work, and in the afternoon, when people are commuting home. There are few rides overnight, and there is a dip in the middle of the day, but there are still often rides.
  
  9. A bar graph of the events versus day of the week. Put day on the y-axis.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = day_of_week)) +
  geom_bar() +
  labs(title = "Number of Rides for Each Day of the Week",
       y = "")
```
  
  This graph demonstrates the count of bike rides on each day. There are the most bike rides during the week, which makes sense as people are using the bikes to commute. It appears that Thursday has the most number of bike rides, while Sunday has the fewest.
  
  10. Facet your graph from exercise 8. by day of the week. Is there a pattern?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60,
         day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_density(fill = "lightblue") +
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week)) +
  labs(title = "Trend in Bike Rides at Time of Day by Day of Week",
       y = "",
       x = "Time") 
```
  
  There is a pattern in the trend in bike rides, in which during the weekdays, there are two peaks of the density of bike rides (commuting times) and on the weekends, there is a flatter peak throughout the day, demonstrating that there are more rides for fun, rather than for specific commutes.
  
The variable `client` describes whether the renter is a regular user (level `Registered`) or has not joined the bike-rental organization (`Causal`). The next set of exercises investigate whether these two different categories of users show different rental behavior and how `client` interacts with the patterns you found in the previous exercises. 

  11. Change the graph from exercise 10 to set the `fill` aesthetic for `geom_density()` to the `client` variable. You should also set `alpha = .5` for transparency and `color=NA` to suppress the outline of the density function.
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60,
         day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_density(aes(fill = client),
               alpha = .5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week)) +
  labs(title = "Trend in Bike Rides at Time of Day by Day of Week",
       y = "",
       x = "") 
```

This graph is similar to the last one, but shows that casual clients use the bikes more for fun during the week, as they probably aren't using the bikes for commutes, while registered clients are using the bikes more often for their commutes. The casual clients are using the bikes more during the middle of the day, and there isn't a huge change between the way they use the bikes on the weekend versus the weeday.

  12. Change the previous graph by adding the argument `position = position_stack()` to `geom_density()`. In your opinion, is this better or worse in terms of telling a story? What are the advantages/disadvantages of each?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60,
         day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_density(aes(fill = client),
               position = position_stack(),
               alpha = .5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(day_of_week)) +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Clients and their Bike Rides at Time of Day by Day of Week")
```

  The position stack allows us to see the trend in rides across different days of the week, while also seeing the density of clients who are casual versus who are registered. At the points where there are peaks, the casual users are significantly more.
  
  13. In this graph, go back to using the regular density plot (without `position = position_stack()`). Add a new variable to the dataset called `weekend` which will be "weekend" if the day is Saturday or Sunday and  "weekday" otherwise (HINT: use the `ifelse()` function and the `wday()` function from `lubridate`). Then, update the graph from the previous problem by faceting on the new `weekend` variable. 
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60,
         day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(weekend = ifelse(day_of_week == c("Sat", "Sun"), "weekend" , "weekday")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) +  
  geom_density(aes(fill = client),
               alpha = .5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(weekend)) +
  labs(title = "Trend in Bike Rides on Weekdays versus Weekends by Client Type")
```
  
  This graph demonstrates the trends in rides on the weekdays versus on the weekends. It shows that on weekdays, registered clients use the bikes during commuting times, while casual clients are using the bikes during off-peak times. Then, on the weekends, the trends are similar between casual and registered clients, with just more ride by casual clients.
  
  14. Change the graph from the previous problem to facet on `client` and fill with `weekday`. What information does this graph tell you that the previous didn't? Is one graph better than the other?
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  mutate(time = hour(sdate) + minute(sdate)/60,
         day_of_week = wday(sdate, label = TRUE)) %>% 
  mutate(`day type` = ifelse(day_of_week == c("Sat", "Sun"), "weekend" , "weekday")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = time)) + 
  geom_density(aes(fill = `day type`),
               alpha = .5) +
  facet_wrap(vars(client)) +
  labs(title = "Trend in Bike Rides for Client Type by Day Type")
```
  
  This graph demonstrates the trend in bike rides for client types and compares these trends based on the weekend or the weekday. The casual clients maintain their trends of bike rides throughout the day, with more rides during the weekends. The registered clients trends in bike rides differ widely depending on the day type, where there are peaks during the weekdays, and just a general peak over the weekends. This graph shows how different clients have different trends, and compares those more directly than the graph in the last question. I don't think one graph is better than the other, I think they just show different things.
  
### Spatial patterns

  15. Use the latitude and longitude variables in `Stations` to make a visualization of the total number of departures from each station in the `Trips` data. Use either color or size to show the variation in number of departures. We will improve this plot next week when we learn about maps!
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  left_join(Stations, by=c("sstation"="name")) %>% 
  group_by(lat, long) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            prop_casual = mean(client == "Casual")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long,
             y = lat,
             color = n)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .8, shape = 17) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Number of Departures from Each Station")
```

I notice that there are lots of rides that start in the center of the city. There are a lot of rides coming from one area, and there are multiple rides at the same longitude and latitude. The colors demonstrate that number difference.

  16. Only 14.4% of the trips in our data are carried out by casual users. Create a plot that shows which area(s) have stations with a much higher percentage of departures by casual users. What patterns do you notice? (Again, we'll improve this next week when we learn about maps).
  
```{r}
Trips %>% 
  left_join(Stations, by=c("sstation"="name")) %>% 
  group_by(lat, long) %>% 
  summarize(n = n(),
            prop_casual = mean(client == "Casual")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = long,
             y = lat,
             color = prop_casual))+
  geom_point(alpha = .8, shape = 17) +
  scale_color_viridis_c() +
  labs(title = "Proportion of Casual Rides at Each Departure Station")
```
  
  This graph demonstrates that the proportion of casual rides is lower at the city center, where there are lots of rides happening, and the color of those points is purple, demonstrating a higher proportion of registered clients. I am also noticing that the rides that are very far out of the city center have a higer proportion of casual rides.
  
**DID YOU REMEMBER TO GO BACK AND CHANGE THIS SET OF EXERCISES TO THE LARGER DATASET? IF NOT, DO THAT NOW.**

## Dogs!

In this section, we'll use the data from 2022-02-01 Tidy Tuesday. If you didn't use that data or need a little refresher on it, see the [website](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2022/2022-02-01/readme.md).

  17. The final product of this exercise will be a graph that has breed on the y-axis and the sum of the numeric ratings in the `breed_traits` dataset on the x-axis, with a dot for each rating. First, create a new dataset called `breed_traits_total` that has two variables -- `Breed` and `total_rating`. The `total_rating` variable is the sum of the numeric ratings in the `breed_traits` dataset (we'll use this dataset again in the next problem). Then, create the graph just described. Omit Breeds with a `total_rating` of 0 and order the Breeds from highest to lowest ranked. You may want to adjust the `fig.height` and `fig.width` arguments inside the code chunk options (eg. `{r, fig.height=8, fig.width=4}`) so you can see things more clearly - check this after you knit the file to assure it looks like what you expected.

```{r, fig.height=15, fig.width=10}
breed_traits_total <- breed_traits %>%
  select(-`Coat Type`, -`Coat Length`) %>% 
  pivot_longer(!Breed,
               names_to = "traits",
               values_to = "rating") %>% 
  group_by(Breed) %>% 
  summarize(total_rating = sum(rating)) %>% 
  filter(total_rating > 0)
  

breed_traits_total %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = total_rating,
            y = fct_reorder(Breed, total_rating))) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Total Rating of Traits by Dog Breed",
       y = "Breed",
       x = "Rating")
```

  18. The final product of this exercise will be a graph with the top-20 dogs in total ratings (from previous problem) on the y-axis, year on the x-axis, and points colored by each breed's ranking for that year (from the `breed_rank_all` dataset). The points within each breed will be connected by a line, and the breeds should be arranged from the highest median rank to lowest median rank ("highest" is actually the smallest numer, eg. 1 = best). After you're finished, think of AT LEAST one thing you could you do to make this graph better. HINTS: 1. Start with the `breed_rank_all` dataset and pivot it so year is a variable. 2. Use the `separate()` function to get year alone, and there's an extra argument in that function that can make it numeric. 3. For both datasets used, you'll need to `str_squish()` Breed before joining. 
  
```{r}
breed_rank_all %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = starts_with("20"),
               names_to = "year",
               values_to = "total_ranking") %>%
  separate(year, into = c("year", "rank"), convert = TRUE) %>%
  mutate(breed_str = str_squish(Breed)) %>% 
  inner_join(breed_traits_total %>% 
                mutate(breed_str = str_squish(Breed)) %>% 
                slice_max(n = 20, order_by = total_rating),
              by = "breed_str") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = year, y = fct_rev(fct_reorder(breed_str, total_ranking, median)),
             color = total_ranking)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(y = "Breed")
```
  
  I think, to make this graph better, it would be helpful to add a line to the graph in order to show that the median ranking remains the same across the years. It could also be helpful to change the colors of the dots, or change the shape or transparency to show how different the rankings are.
  
  19. Create your own! Requirements: use a `join` or `pivot` function (or both, if you'd like), a `str_XXX()` function, and a `fct_XXX()` function to create a graph using any of the dog datasets. One suggestion is to try to improve the graph you created for the Tidy Tuesday assignment. If you want an extra challenge, find a way to use the dog images in the `breed_rank_all` file - check out the `ggimage` library and [this resource](https://wilkelab.org/ggtext/) for putting images as labels.
  
```{r}
breed_traits %>%
  left_join(breed_rank_all, by= "Breed") %>% 
  mutate(name_length = str_length(Breed)) %>% 
  select(c(`Breed`,
           `2020 Rank`,
           name_length)) %>% 
  na.omit() %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = `2020 Rank`,
             x = name_length,
             color = Breed)) +
  geom_point() +
  labs(title = "Dog Rank in 2020 by Name Length")
```

**DID YOU REMEMBER TO UNCOMMENT THE OPTIONS AT THE TOP?**
